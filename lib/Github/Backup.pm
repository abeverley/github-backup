=head1 SYNOPSIS

    github-backup \
        --user stevieb9 \
        --token 003e12e0780025889f8da286d89d144323c20c1ff7 \
        --dir /home/steve/github-backup \
        --repos \
        --issues

    # You can store the token in an environment variable as opposed to sending
    # it on the command line

    export GITHUB_TOKEN=003e12e0780025889f8da286d89d144323c20c1ff7

    github-backup -u stevieb9 -d ~/github-backup -r -i

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The cloud is a wonderful thing, but things do happen. Use this distribution to
back up all of your Github repositories and/or issues to your local machine for
both assurance of data accessibility due to outage, data loss, or just simply
off-line use.

=head1 COMMAND LINE USAGE

=head2 -u | --user

Mandatory: Your Github username.

=head2 -t | --token

Mandatory: Your Github API token. If you wish to not include this on the
command line, you can put the token into the C<GITHUB_TOKEN> environment
variable. Specifying the token in the C<GITHUB_TOKEN> environment variable also
enables private repositories to be accessed, as github_backup will use the
environment variable via the github_backup_pass command and git's
C<GIT_ASKPASS> option to pass the required authentication information to git
when cloning a repository.

=head2 -l | --list

Optional: Simply prints a list of all available repositories for the specified
user.

=head2 -d | --dir

Mandatory (if using C<--repos> or C<--issues>): The backup directory where your
repositories and/or issues will be stored. The format of the directory
structure will be as follows:

    backup_dir/
        - issues/
            - repo1/
                - open
                    - issue_id_x
                - closed
                    - issue_id_y
            - repo2/
                - open
                    - issue_id_a
        - repo1/
            - repository data
        - repo2/
            - repository data

The repositories are stored as found on Github. The issues are stored in JSON
format.

=head2 -r | --repos

Optional: Back up all of your repositories found on Github.

=head2 -i | --issues

Optional: Back up all of your issues across all of your Github repositories.
This includes both open and closed issues.

=head2 -p | --proxy

Optional: Send in a proxy in the format C<https://proxy.example.com:PORT> and
we'll use this to do our fetching.

=head2 -h | --help

Display the usage information page.

=head1 MODULE METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiates and returns a new L<Github::Backup> object.

Parameters:

=head3 api_user

Mandatory, String: Your Github username.

=head3 token

Mandatory, String: Your Github API token. Note that if you do not wish to store
this in code, you can put it into the C<GITHUB_TOKEN> environment variable,
and we'll read it in from there instead.

=head3 dir

Mandatory, String: The directory that you wish to store your downloaded Github
information to.

=head3 proxy

Optional, String: Send in a proxy in the format
C<https://proxy.example.com:PORT> and we'll use this to do our fetching.

=head3 _clean

Optional, Bool. Used only for testing. Tells C<< DESTROY >> to remove the
backup directory.

=head2 limit

Optional, Integer: Sets the number of repositories we'll operate on. Used
primarily for testing.

Default: Unlimited.

=head2 list

Takes no parameters. Returns a list of all repository objects as returned from
L<Pithub> / the Github API.

Common fields are C<$repo-E<gt>{name}>, C<$repo-E<gt>{clone_url}> etc.

=head2 repos

Takes no parameters. Backs up all of your Github repositories, and stores them
in the specified backup directory.

=head2 issues

Takes no parameters. Backs up all of your Github issues. Stores them per-repo
within the C</backup_dir/issues> directory. Structure of the issues directory
is as follows:

    backup_dir/
        - issues/
            - repo/
                - open/
                    - issue_x
                - closed/
                    - issue_y
            - repo2/
                - open/
                - closed/

=head2 finish

Takes no parameters. Normally, we copy the staging backup directory to the
actual backup directory at the time we destroy the object. Call this method to
set up the backup directory immediately.

=head1 FUTURE DIRECTION

- Slowly, I will add new functionality such as backing up *all* Github data, as
well as provide the ability to restore to Github the various items.

- Add more tests. Usually I don't release a distribution with such few tests,
but in this case I have. I digress.
