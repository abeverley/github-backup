=head1 NAME

Github::Backup - Back up your Github repositories and/or issues locally

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    github_backup \
        --user stevieb9 \
        --token 003e12e0780025889f8da286d89d144323c20c1ff7 \
        --dir /home/steve/github_backup \
        --repos \
        --issues

    # You can store the token in an environment variable as opposed to sending
    # it on the command line

    export GITHUB_TOKEN=003e12e0780025889f8da286d89d144323c20c1ff7

    github_backup -u stevieb9 -d ~/github_backup -r

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The cloud is a wonderful thing, but things do happen. Use this distribution to
back up all of your Github repositories and/or issues to your local machine for
both assurance of data accessibility due to outage, data loss, or just simply
off-line use.

=head1 COMMAND LINE USAGE

=head2 -u | --user

Mandatory: Your Github username.

=head2 -t | --token

Mandatory: Your Github API token. If you wish to not include this on the
command line, you can put the token into the C<GITHUB_TOKEN> environment
variable.

=head2 -d | --dir

Mandatory: The backup directory where your repositories and/or issues will be
stored. The format of the directory structure will be as follows:

    backup_dir/
        - issues/
            - repo1/
                - issue_id_x
                - issue_id_y
            - repo2/
                - issue_id_a
        - repo1/
            - repository data
        - repo2/
            - repository data

The repositories are stored as found on Github. The issues are stored in JSON
format.

=head2 -r | --repos

Optional: Back up all of your repositories found on Github.

Note that either C<--repos> or C<--issues> must be sent in.

=head2 -i | --issues

Optional: Back up all of your issues across all of your Github repositories.

Note that either C<--issues> or C<--repos> must be sent in.

=head2 -p | --proxy

Optional: Send in a proxy in the format C<https://proxy.example.com:PORT> and
we'll use this to do our fetching.

=head2 -h | --help

Display the usage information page.

=head1 MODULE METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiates and returns a new L<Github::Backup> object.

Parameters:

=head3 api_user

Mandatory, String: Your Github username.

=head3 token

Mandatory, String: Your Github API token. Note that if you do not wish to store
this in code, you can put it into the C<GITHUB_TOKEN> environment variable,
and we'll read it in from there instead.

=head3 dir

Mandatory, String: The directory that you wish to store your downloaded Github
information to.

=head3 proxy

Optional, String: Send in a proxy in the format
C<https://proxy.example.com:PORT> and we'll use this to do our fetching.

=head2 repos

Takes no parameters. Backs up all of your Github repositories, and stores them
in the specified backup directory.

=head2 issues

Takes no parameters. Backs up all of your Github issues. Stores them per-repo
within the C</backup_dir/issues> directory.

=head1 FUTURE DIRECTION

- Slowly, I will add new functionality such as backing up *all* Github data, as
well as provide the ability to restore to Github the various items.

- Add more tests. Usually I don't release a distribution with such few tests,
but in this case I have. I digress.
